# RNN Language Model

This project implements the minimal RNN architectures (minGRU and minLSTM) proposed in the paper "Were RNNs All We Needed?" by Leo Feng et al. It applies these models to a character-level language modeling task using Shakespeare's text.

## Key Equations and Concepts

### Parallel Scan Algorithm

The core of the efficiency in these models comes from the parallel scan algorithm. For a sequence of operations:

$v_t = a_t \odot v_{t-1} + b_t$

The parallel scan computes all $v_t$ efficiently in parallel.

### minGRU

The minGRU update in log-space:

$\log(z_t) = -\text{softplus}(-k_t)$
$\log(1 - z_t) = -\text{softplus}(k_t)$

where $k_t = W_z x_t$

### minLSTM

The minLSTM update in log-space:

$\log(f'_t) = -\text{softplus}(\text{softplus}(-p_t) - \text{softplus}(-k_t))$
$\log(i'_t) = -\text{softplus}(\text{softplus}(-k_t) - \text{softplus}(-p_t))$

where $k_t = W_i x_t$ and $p_t = W_f x_t$

### Activation Function

The continuous activation function $g(x)$ and its log-space version:

$g(x) = \begin{cases} x + 0.5, & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ \sigma(x), & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

$\log(g(x)) = \begin{cases} \log(x + 0.5), & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -\text{softplus}(-x), & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

### Parallel Scan in Log-Space

The parallel scan algorithm in log-space is implemented as:

$a^* = \text{pad}(\text{cumsum}(\log(a_{1:T})), (1, 0))$
$\log(h_0 + b^*) = \text{logcumsumexp}(\log(b_{1:T}) - a^*)$
$\log(h) = a^* + \log(h_0 + b^*)$

## Model Architecture

The language model consists of:
1. An embedding layer: $x_t = \text{Embed}(w_t)$
2. Multiple layers of either minLSTM or minGRU: $h_t = \text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$
3. A final linear layer for prediction: $y_t = Wh_t + b$

## Training

The model is trained using AdamW optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss:

$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_t \log p(w_t | w_{<t})$

where $p(w_t | w_{<t})$ is the predicted probability of the correct word.

## Usage

1. Create a virtual environment using reqs.txt.
```sh
  > virtualenv simplified_rnns
  > source simplified_rnns/bin/activate
  > pip install -r reqs.txt
```
2. Replace "path_to_shakespeare_data.txt" with the path to your Shakespeare dataset.
3. Download Shakespeare's plays, sonnets, and poems at [this link](https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/download/) as text files.
4. Concantenate all files together.
5. Place dataset into an appropriate folder.
6. Go into directory of this repo.
```sh
cd rnns-lstm-gru-simplified/
```
7. Rename example_settings.cfg to settings.cfg, and create logs/ directory.
```sh
 > mv example_settings.cfg settings.cfg
 > mkdir logs/
```
8. Edit settings.cfg with local location of shakespeare dataset
9. Run the script: ./run.sh
```sh
 > ./run.sh
 or
 > sh run.sh
```
